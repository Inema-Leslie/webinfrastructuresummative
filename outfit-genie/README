Deployment & Load Balancer Setup
1. Deployed the Node.js app to both web servers (6450-web-01, 6450-web-02) using Git and PM2 for process management.

2. Configured HAProxy on 6450-lb-01 to balance traffic between the two web servers using a roundrobin algorithm with health checks.

3. Testing & Verification:

Confirmed traffic distribution via HAProxy stats.

Validated failover by stopping one server.

Ensured sessions persisted correctly.

Key Notes:

Used port 80 for HAProxy and 3000 for backend servers.

Enabled firewall rules for necessary ports.

Monitored performance using curl and HAProxyâ€™s built-in stats.
